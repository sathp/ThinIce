# Project Proposal - Thin Ice
This project will aim to build an arcade game, Thin Ice, that was once offered as a part of the Club Penguin experience.

## Objective of the Game
The objective of the game is to finish a maze made of thin ice. Once a block of thin ice is stepped on, it melts and the player can no longer step on it. The player must melt all the ice to finish the stage. 

## Gameplay
1. Players use their arrow keys to move their character around a set of pre-programmed mazes. 
2. More points are earned for solving the stage by walking over all of the ice.
3. Solve each level on your first try, and coin bags will appear which you can collect to gain even more points.

## Implementation
This game is going to be built in C++ and will make use of the following libraries/frameworks:

1. [OpenFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks)
2. OpenFrameworks Wrapper for Box2D by [Vanderlin](https://github.com/vanderlin) found [here](https://github.com/vanderlin/ofxBox2d). 

## Milestones (Deprecated)

1. Establishing a 3D Environment
2. Designing Sprites, Components and Environmnet Objects
3. Enabling Interactions between Objects
4. Establishing Game Logic
5. Auto-generating mazes as colored graphs
